## SnowEffect

Draws snowflakes into a 4x4 repeating character grid that
is shifted half height every other column. The snow background is
shown as part of a multicolor text screen, where the snow is shown in any screen character that is empty.

To build the source in windows go to the SnowEffect folder in
a command prompt and run the build batch file. This will convert
the png images in the art folder and assemble the code.
